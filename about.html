            About RENEWAL
        </h2>
        <article class="about-renewal-content">
            <p>Receiving a diagnosis of irreversible kidney failure can be devastating. That’s where Renewal comes in.
                We help patients and their families navigate the complex process of kidney transplant, from finding a
                donor to arranging the transplant and beyond. At the same time, we support donors to make sure their
                incredible self-sacrifice is as simple and safe as it can be.</p>

            <p>When we began back in 2006, our purpose was to support potential kidney donors through the challenging
                process of decision making and donation. But as we learned more and more about the process and gathered
                resources, we became the go-to organization for all kidney related issues. Today, almost every major
                transplant center in the country reaches out to Renewal for information, support, and the kinds of
                services we provide. Many have asked to copy our model.</p>

            <p>Renewal saves lives by helping facilitate kidney transplants for those suffering with chronic kidney
                disease. We provide guidance and support to help patients and their families navigate all the medical
                challenges of coping with their condition. Our services are free of charge to anyone in need.</p>

            <p>In the coming years we hope to greatly expand our registry — the databank of potential donors that can
                be called on when a match is needed. We are proud of the fact that Renewal facilitated the first
                international kidney swap. We are now working to be the first registry to arrange and perform overseas
                kidney swaps in which the donated organ is shipped to the recipient’s location. We hope to expand our
                comprehensive services to communities around the world.

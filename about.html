                    <p>Receiving a diagnosis of irreversible kidney failure can be devastating. That’s where Renewal
                        comes in.
                        We help patients and their families navigate the complex process of kidney transplant, from
                        finding a
                        donor to arranging the transplant and beyond. At the same time, we support donors to make sure
                        their
                        incredible self-sacrifice is as simple and safe as it can be.</p>

                    <p>When we began back in 2006, our purpose was to support potential kidney donors through the
                        challenging
                        process of decision making and donation. But as we learned more and more about the process and
                        gathered
                        resources, we became the go-to organization for all kidney related issues. Today, almost every
                        major
                        transplant center in the country reaches out to Renewal for information, support, and the kinds
                        of
                        services we provide. Many have asked to copy our model.</p>

                    <p>Renewal saves lives by helping facilitate kidney transplants for those suffering with chronic
                        kidney
                        disease. We provide guidance and support to help patients and their families navigate all the
                        medical
                        challenges of coping with their condition. Our services are free of charge to anyone in
                        need.</p>

                    <p>In the coming years we hope to greatly expand our registry — the databank of potential donors
                        that can
                        be called on when a match is needed. We are proud of the fact that Renewal facilitated the first
                        international kidney swap. We are now working to be the first registry to arrange and perform
                        overseas
                        kidney swaps in which the donated organ is shipped to the recipient’s location. We hope to
                        expand our
                        comprehensive services to communities around the world.

                    <p>As is often the case in a serious medical diagnosis, the patient and family can quickly be
                        overwhelmed by the pronouncement that one is suffering from irreversible kidney failure. With
                        the increased frequency of transplants from non related donors, it was decided to start an
                        organization dedicated to assisting people suffering from various forms of kidney disease. About
                        ten years ago through the initiative of a few caring individuals, Renewal was created.</p>
                    <p>Although the aim is to help in any way possible, the ultimate goal is obtaining a kidney for
                        those that would like to undergo a transplant. On the waiting list are people from all walks of
                        life, and of all ages. Men, women and children ranging in age from a young child to an 80 year
                        old adult. They are from all parts of the world, including the USA, Canada, Israel as well as
                        England and Brazil. They all wait for that call that a match has been found. These people are
                        willing to travel to be in an area closer to the location of the donor, if necessary. Renewal
                        has been successful in helping many of these patients, but the need is still great. Each year, 8
                        percent of the patients on the national list die waiting for a kidney. If you feel that this is
                        something that you can do, it would be a great mitzvah indeed to help any one of these
                        patients.</p>
                    <p>Understandably, the first place one would look for a donor is within the family. With kidney
                        disease however, this is not always the solution. Many times the ailment is a familial one and
                        therefore the family members are suffering from the same condition. Other times the family is
                        small and the few that are of age to donate are either not the same blood type and/or not
                        compatible for various other reasons. Many of our coreligionists are suffering emotionally,
                        physically, and financially as are their families. Jewish leaders both in Israel and the U.S.
                        have stated the greatness of this act and have enthusiastically supported those that have given
                        a kidney.</p>
                    <p>All costs of the actual procedure are covered by the recipient’s insurance. Transportation for
                        the testing, if needed, is taken care of by Renewal as is food, lodging for a family member
                        wishing to be with the donor during the hospital stay. Renewal’s goal is to assist each and
                        every patient and donor with any help and support they may need.</p>
